              <h1>Database Types</h1>

              <p class="rb-text-grey">There are two types of databases that are used for web applications; Relational and Non-Relational databases.
                  A relational database is a collection of data that is <b>structured</b> and accessed in order to locate specific information.
                  It does this by maintaining a relationship between two or more entities. Some benefits of relational databases are its scalability,
                  ease-of-use, integrity of the data and uptime/reliability of the database. Some downsides of relational databases are that it's slow
                  to pull data, inability to store documents/graphs in original format, sparse data storage and fixed schema (unable to change the structure
                  once created).
              </p>
                <p class="rb-text-grey">A non-relational database is a collection of data that is <b>unstructured</b> and doesn't have a strict distinction
                    between rows, columns and their relations. Due to this increased flexibility, these databases are generally faster and more flexible.
                  Some benefits of relational databases are its scalability, ease-of-use, speed, and processing time. Some downsides of relational databases are that
                    it can struggle with large datasets, difficulty updating data, prone to unexpected behavior and lack of standardization between each of the vendors
                    for non-relational databases.</p>
